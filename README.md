## Project title:
Weathering With You

## What and why?
Weathering With You is a weather app that will help its users make decisions based off the current weather. The app reccomend the user outfits and activities according to the weather along with alerts for upcoming weather reports. The outfits will be simple and customized to the user's preferences. There will be categories for different types of activities that the users may enjoy.

## For whom?
This app is for anyone who needs an idea of what to wear when going outside. It is for forgetful people who need an extra reminder to bring their umbrella and wear their rain boots. Additionally, the app will inspire those who want to spend their day outside of the house, but can not think of what to do.

## How?
The user will start off by making a profile and an avatar. From there on, the app will give recommendations based off a basic idea of what to wear (ex: long sleeve, shorts, t-shirt, etc.). If the user chooses, they will log what outfit they wore for the day and using that information, the app will alter its recommendations based off of the data given.

In addition to the outfit page, there will be a page dedicated to "Things to do." Visiting this page will give the user categories of activities such as Dates, Friends, Solo, etc. From there the user will recieve a list of activities they can enjoy based on the weather. Depending on what the user chooses, the app would then take the user to a list of locations near them where this activity can be done. For example, if the user decides they want to do a Solo activity, and chose to go to a park, the app will send the user to a map of close parks nearby.

## Scope
I am not sure if this project would be appropriate for the time period, but in the case it is too easy, there can be many more features added onto the project, such as customization of the outfits. In the case the project is too ambitious, I believe there are elements of the project that can be cut while maintaining the main concept of the app.
